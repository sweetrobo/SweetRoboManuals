## Recommended Migration Plan

### CRITICAL: F2 Model Only
**All content migration must focus exclusively on the F2 model. When sections contain information for both F1 and F2:**
- Extract ONLY F2-specific information
- Ignore F1 specifications, capacities, and features
- If content applies to both models, include it
- If content is F1-specific, exclude it

### Phase 1: Core Content (Priority)
1. **overview.md**: Combine Sections 03, 07 (F2 only), 09 (F2 specs), 11
2. **safety.md**: Combine Sections 04, 08, 15
3. **setup.md**: Combine Sections 05 (setup parts), 10, 12
4. **operation.md**: Section 18 + ice cream mix prep (Section 17)
5. **maintenance.md**: Combine Sections 14, 19
6. **troubleshooting.md**: Section 16 + support info

### Phase 2: Images
- Convert all images to WebP format
- Organize into appropriate asset folders
- Update image references in markdown

### Phase 3: Consolidation
- Remove duplicate content
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Add cross-references between sections

### Phase 4: Enhancement
- Add missing content from other resources
- Improve formatting for mdbook
- Add navigation helpers

## Missing Content
Based on comparison with typical manuals:
- Detailed parts diagrams with part numbers
- Warranty registration process
- Advanced troubleshooting procedures
- Network setup instructions
- Software update procedures

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1 content migration (F2 ONLY)
2. Create image conversion list
3. Review for completeness and ensure no F1 content remains
4. Test build with mdbook
