4. Turn ON Compressor switch (avoid leaving on with doors open)
5. System initialization begins
6. Wait for touchscreen to illuminate

**Source: `/12 Section 7 Startup & Loading/1 7. Startup & Loading.md`**
1. Connect power cord to grounded outlet
2. Ensure breaker switch is OFF
3. Verify internal components connected
4. Turn breaker switch ON

## Mix Preparation

### Powder-Based Mix Instructions
**Source: `/17 Section 12 Preparing Ice Cream Mix/1 🧪 Preparing Ice Cream Mix (Powder-Based).md`**
  <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: i see this now, move it to the correct position it the steps to prepare icecream above, or above make a short list and direct the user to this section... but since this will also be printed in pdf, i feel like we might need to write things that are important earlier in the file and then later we can send the user back up, i need your help to decide which is better option -->

**Required Tools:**
- Mixing bucket (at least 5L)
- Food-safe electric mixer or whisk
- Clean stirring rod
- Fresh drinking-grade water

**Instructions:**
1. Pour 4 liters fresh water into mixing bucket
2. Slowly pour one 1.5 kg bag of powder
3. Let sit briefly to begin dissolving
4. Mix 2-3 minutes until smooth and clump-free
5. Avoid over-mixing (causes excess foam)
6. Transfer slowly to hopper
7. Light foam layer is normal
8. First fill: Use 2 bags minimum (3kg powder + 8L water)

**Ongoing Refills:**
- Stir remaining mix at base before refilling
- Prevents powder settling/layering
- Always sanitize tools before/after use

## Conflicting Information

### 1. Machine Weight Discrepancy
- **Technical Specs**: 250 kg (551 lbs)
- **Unpacking Sections**: 380 kg (848 lbs)  <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: this should be the correct info, empty. -->
- **Possible Explanation**: 250kg may be empty weight, 380kg may include full hoppers and consumables

### 2. Power Requirements for F2
- **One source**: 13A for 220V circuit
- **Another source**: Draws ~26A at full load
- **Resolution needed**: Verify actual amperage requirements  <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: see in context earlier regarding this -->

### 3. Space Requirements
- **One source**: 90 × 105 × 250 cm minimum
- **Another source**: Only provides clearance distances   <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: see in context earlier regarding this, the clearence should be combined or explained clearly together with the machine sizes -->
- **Note**: First measurement may include operational space

### 4. Accessory Contents
- **Basic list**: Machine, manual, keys
- **Detailed list**: Includes cups, cleaning kit, tool kit
- **Possible Explanation**: Basic list may assume accessories packed inside
  <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: both ingo looks good. add images (WE ALREADY HAVE THEM.) -->

## Notes for Manual Creation

1. **Weight Specification**: Need to clarify if 250kg is empty weight and 380kg is operational weight
2. **Power Requirements**: F2 amperage needs verification (13A vs 26A discrepancy)
3. **Timer Configuration**: Referenced but no detailed instructions found in reviewed sections
4. **Backend System Access**: Referenced for manual discharge but not detailed in setup sections
5. **Compressor Switch**: Location and operation needs clarification

This compilation should be used to create a unified, accurate setup.md file, resolving conflicts where possible and noting where additional verification is needed.
