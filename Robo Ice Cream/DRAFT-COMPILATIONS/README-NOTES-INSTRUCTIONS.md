# Draft Compilation Notes Instructions

## Overview
This folder contains compiled information from the draft resources, organized by manual section. Each file consolidates content from multiple sources, identifies conflicts, and provides a foundation for the final manual.

## How These Files Were Created
These compilation files were generated by:
1. Systematically reviewing all files in the `/resources/Draft/` folder
2. Extracting relevant content for each manual section
3. Documenting source file references for traceability
4. Identifying conflicting information between sources
5. Converting measurements to include both metric and imperial units
6. Organizing content by logical categories

## How to Add Your Notes

### Recommended Format: HTML Comments
Add your notes using HTML comments with the following format:
```markdown
<!-- LIGHTWING [TYPE]: [Your note here] -->
```

### Note Types:
- **NOTE**: General observations or clarifications
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING NOTE: This voltage specification is for US models only -->
  ```

- **TODO**: Action items that need to be completed
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING TODO: Add photos of the control panel interface -->
  ```

- **QUESTION**: Items needing clarification or verification
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING QUESTION: Is the 3-day limit for all mix types? -->
  ```

- **DECISION**: Final choices or resolutions
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING DECISION: Use 50cm rear clearance (more conservative) -->
  ```

- **CONFLICT**: Highlighting conflicting information
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING CONFLICT: Manual says 13A but specs show 26A -->
  ```

- **VERIFY**: Facts that need checking with team/documentation
  ```markdown
  <!-- LIGHTWING VERIFY: Confirm F2 power requirements with engineering -->
  ```

### Why HTML Comments?
- **Invisible in preview** - Won't clutter the rendered markdown
- **Searchable** - Easy to find all notes with "LIGHTWING" search
- **Categorized** - Filter by type (TODO, QUESTION, etc.)
- **Clean removal** - Simple to remove when resolved
- **Non-intrusive** - Won't affect final formatting

## What This Provides

### For Manual Development:
1. **Single source of truth** - All relevant content in one place per section
2. **Conflict resolution** - Clear identification of inconsistencies
3. **Traceability** - Every piece of information linked to source
4. **Completeness check** - See what's missing or incomplete
5. **Review efficiency** - Systematic way to review and approve content

### For Collaboration:
1. **Clear communication** - Your notes guide the final implementation
2. **Prioritization** - TODO and VERIFY tags show what needs attention
3. **Decision tracking** - DECISION tags document choices made
4. **Quality assurance** - CONFLICT tags ensure accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Review each compilation file
2. Add your notes using the HTML comment format
3. Pay special attention to sections marked "Conflicting Information"
4. Identify any missing critical information
5. Make decisions on conflicting specifications
6. Note any additional content needed from other sources

## File Structure
- `SETUP-INFO-COMPILATION.md` - Installation and initial setup
- `OPERATION-INFO-COMPILATION.md` - User interfaces and operation procedures  
- `MAINTENANCE-INFO-COMPILATION.md` - Cleaning, maintenance, and schedules
- `TROUBLESHOOTING-INFO-COMPILATION.md` - Problem diagnosis and solutions
- `SAFETY-INFO-COMPILATION.md` - All safety warnings and procedures

Each file contains:
- Table of contents
- Categorized information
- Source references
- Conflicting information section
- Notes for manual creation

## Example Workflow
```markdown
### Machine Weight Discrepancy
- **Technical Specs**: 250 kg (551 lbs)
- **Unpacking Sections**: 380 kg (848 lbs)
<!-- LIGHTWING QUESTION: Which weight is correct? Empty vs full? -->
<!-- LIGHTWING TODO: Add note explaining weight difference -->
<!-- LIGHTWING DECISION: List both - 250kg empty, 380kg operational -->
```
