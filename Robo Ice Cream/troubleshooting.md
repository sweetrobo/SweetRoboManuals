# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Machine Won't Make Ice Cream After Power On

**Symptom:** Machine is on but not producing ice cream

**Cause:** Machine needs time to reach operating temperature

**Solution:**
1. After turning on power and refrigeration switch, wait 5-10 minutes
2. Check temperature status on screen (L: 100% or R: 100% indicates ready)
3. Machine will only dispense once internal temperature is cold enough

### Core Board Error

**Symptom:** "Core board error" message on screen, loud grinding noise

**Cause:** Hopper turned on without liquid, causing metal-on-metal contact

**Solution:**
1. **Immediately turn off the machine**
2. Fill each hopper with at least 2 liters of prepared mix (3L water + 1 gelato mix packet)
3. Turn on the hopper switch (located on bottom of hopper)
4. Turn on the machine
5. Error should clear once liquid is detected

**Prevention:** Always fill hoppers before turning on machine

### Cup Dispenser Issues

**Symptom:** Cup doesn't drop when customer orders

**Solution:**
1. Access backend (tap and hold top-right corner for 3-5 seconds)
2. Enter password: 123456
3. Navigate to Device Testing
4. Try these functions:
   - "Cup Out" - dispenses one cup
   - "Reset Cup Holder" - realigns the system
5. Check that cups are:
   - Loaded correctly in tubes
   - Properly aligned
   - Not jammed or stuck together

### Syrup Not Dispensing

**Symptom:** Syrup pumps activate but no syrup comes out

**Solution:**
1. Access backend settings
2. Go to Stock Settings menu
3. Verify stock levels are set correctly
4. Navigate to Parameter Settings
5. Find Syrup 1, 2, 3 options
6. Place a cup under syrup tip
7. Press play/test for each syrup
8. Run multiple times until syrup flows (air bubbles may need clearing)

**Alternative test:**
- Go to Device Testing → Jams/Sprinkles Test
- Test each syrup dispenser manually

### Toppings Not Dispensing

**Symptom:** Topping dispensers activate but nothing comes out

**Solution:**
1. Check Stock Settings for correct levels
2. Ensure using only dry, solid toppings (no chunks or thick sauces)
3. Test via Device Testing → Jams/Sprinkles Test
4. Check for clogs in dispenser mechanism

### Temperature Display Questions

**What "L: 100%" or "R: 100%" means:**
- L = Left hopper temperature status
- R = Right hopper temperature status
- 100% = Hopper at correct serving temperature
- Lower percentages = Still cooling down

### Machine Not Accepting Payment

**Nayax Reader Issues:**
1. Ensure Nayax is properly installed behind cash box
2. Check COM2 connection to machine
3. Verify marshal cover is in place
4. Complete Nayax registration if not done
5. Contact Nayax support if error persists

### WiFi Connection Problems

**Solution:**
1. Access backend settings
2. Go to System Settings
3. Look at bottom right corner (buttons may be hard to see)
4. Press "Exit App" to access Android settings
5. Connect to WiFi through Android WiFi settings
6. Return to the app

### Mix Not Freezing Properly

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient mix in hopper (needs minimum 2L)
- Cooling not activated in settings
- Mix ratio incorrect (should be 3L water to 1 packet)

**Solution:**
1. Verify at least 2L of mix in each hopper
2. Access Parameter Settings
3. Find ice cream options: "Clean", "Cool", "Thaw"
4. Select "Cooling" option
5. Allow 5-10 minutes for proper cooling

### Emergency Shutdown

**Proper shutdown procedure:**
1. Switch off main power to ice cream machine
2. Use breaker switch to cut power
3. **Never unplug machine while running**
