**9\. Cleaning & Maintenance**

Keeping the Robo Ice Cream machine clean is critical for ensuring food safety, preserving machine functionality, and complying with health regulations. The steps below outline what must be done daily, weekly, and every 3 days. Cleaning logs must be maintained at all times.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only trained staff should perform internal cleaning. Always shut off ice cream-related systems before starting using the main I/O switch. Never leave mix in hoppers longer than 3 days.

General Food Safety Notes

* All cleaning agents must be **food-safe** and approved for use on food equipment.
* Use only **warm water**, neutral detergents, and food-grade sanitizers.
* Avoid harsh or corrosive chemicals (see  list in Section 10).
* Never allow expired mix to remain in the machine.
* Use separate tools for food-contact areas and waste zones to **avoid cross-contamination**.

‚∏ª

Cleaning Expired Ice Cream Mix

* Ice cream mix must be discarded after **3 days** in the hopper.
* Drain any remaining mix fully before cleaning.
* Hopper temperature sensors will automatically prevent dispensing if the internal temperature exceeds **41¬∞F (5¬∞C)**. When this occurs, mix is considered spoiled.
* Clean and sanitize hopper(s) before refilling.

‚úÖ Do not operate the machine with an empty hopper. Always verify mix level before startup.

### Syrup and Topping Maintenance

Syrup Containers:

* ‚Ä¢	Clean **weekly** using warm water and a food-safe sanitizer.
* Disconnect and flush tubing to avoid clogs and sugar buildup.
* Inspect nozzles for stickiness or discoloration.

Topping Containers:

* ‚Ä¢	Clean **once a week** to prevent clumping, cross-contamination, or pest risk.
* Remove dry contents, wipe internal walls, and sanitize surfaces.

‚úÖ Log each cleaning and refill of syrup and topping containers with date/time and operator initials.


Food Safety

#### Cleaning Expired Ice Cream Mix

Ice cream mix stored in hoppers for more than **3 days** must be discarded.

‚úÖ To prevent contamination, the entire system must be cleaned and sanitized **at least once every 3 days**, even if the machine was idle.

#### Syrup Container Maintenance

Syrup containers and their tubing should be cleaned **weekly** to avoid bacterial buildup and prevent clogging in the lines.

#### Topping Container Maintenance

Dry topping containers must be cleaned **once per week** to prevent clumping, staleness, and microbial growth.

#### Cleaning & Refill Log

Operators must maintain a **logbook or digital record** of each cleaning session and each refill of:

* Ice cream mix
* Syrup containers
* Topping containers

‚úÖ This log should include the **date, time, and operator name**, making it easy to track when each component was last serviced and plan the next required cleaning.

üîÑ *After cleaning, refill using the proper mix process outlined in Section 12.*
