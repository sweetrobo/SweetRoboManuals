‚∏ª

Positioning Requirements

The machine must be installed on a stable, level surface in a clean, dry indoor environment.

**Minimum Clearance:**

| Location | Required Distance |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| Rear wall  | 50 cm (20 in) minimum  |
| Side-to-side  | 20 cm (8 in) minimum  |
| Front (door)  | Must open to 135¬∞+  |

‚∏ª

**Floor Requirements:**

‚Ä¢	Must support a weight of **at least 380 kg** (F2)

‚Ä¢	Surface must be hard (no soft mats or carpet)

‚Ä¢	Do not tilt, rock, or roll the machine once upright

‚Ä¢	Use proper equipment if repositioning

‚∏ª

Power Preparation

**Robo Ice Cream F1:**

‚Ä¢	Connect to a grounded **110V or 220V** outlet (verify your unit‚Äôs voltage label before installation)

‚Ä¢	Requires a **dedicated 25A breaker** (30A recommended to allow for startup current and safety margin)

‚Ä¢	Do **not** share the circuit with other appliances

**Robo Ice Cream F2:**

‚Ä¢	Must be connected to a **dedicated 220V power source**

‚Ä¢	If only a 110V supply is available:

‚Ä¢	A **step-up transformer** can be used, but it must support:

‚Ä¢	**At least 2,860W continuous output**

‚Ä¢	A **dedicated 30A circuit** on the 110V input side (F2 draws \~26A at full load)

‚Ä¢	Proper grounding and isolation from other loads

‚Ä¢	Do **not** share the circuit with other appliances

‚ö†Ô∏è Using an undersized transformer or a shared circuit may result in **machine malfunction, tripped breakers, or permanent damage**. Always verify your power source before installation.

‚∏ª

Hardware Timer Setup

The Robo Ice Cream machine includes a **physical hardware timer** that controls its daily operation hours. This timer:

‚Ä¢	Is located inside the cabinet

‚Ä¢	Must be configured manually using the physical buttons

‚Ä¢	Is independent of the software interface

Operators must program this timer according to the site‚Äôs business hours. Incorrect setup may prevent the machine from powering up at expected times.

‚∏ª

Anchoring and Stabilization

‚Ä¢	Ensure all four adjustable feet are firmly on the ground

‚Ä¢	Tighten locking collars to prevent wobble

‚Ä¢	If required by local regulations or high-traffic environments, anchor the machine to the floor or a secured wall using optional mounting brackets (not included by default, contact Sweet Robo support for more information)
