# Maintenance 

## Food Safety

#### Candy Container Maintenance

To prevent candy from melting and potentially damaging the machine, ensure the refrigerator is turned on, especially in hot or humid environments. Cooler, drier locations may not require the extra cooling as much. Remember that excessive heat can cause the candy to melt and lead to operational problems.

### Physical Safety

#### Automatic Door Maintenance

Before performing any maintenance on the automatic door, power must be turned off. If testing or debugging with power on, use extreme caution to avoid injury—particularly the risk of pinching from moving parts.

#### Machine Wheels

This machine is not designed for long-distance pushing, as the wheels may become damaged. If a wheel replacement is needed, special lifting equipment is required—do not attempt to tilt or turn the machine on its side, as this may cause serious damage.

### Electrical Safety

#### Maintenance & Safety Guidelines

Before performing any maintenance on the machine, ensure all power sources are completely disconnected. Maintenance should only be carried out by someone with basic electrical knowledge to prevent injury or damage.

Important: Never unplug the machine directly while it is powered on. Always use the Breaker Switch to safely shut down the system before disconnecting the power plug.

Even with these precautions, we strongly recommend informing a Sweet Robo technician of any issues and planned maintenance actions. Our team is here to support you and ensure everything is done safely and correctly.

Please note: Any unauthorized modifications or changes to the machine may void the warranty. Always seek approval or guidance before making adjustments.

### Appearance of vending machine 

When replenishing goods each time, the machine might have dust, which can be wiped with a dry cloth. If it is dirty, clean it with a damp cloth dipped with warm water or neutral detergent. 

To clean, avoid using thinner, volatile oil, solvents, strong alkaline detergents, or other chemicals. These substances can corrode or crack the paint and plastic components.

It is recommended to clean each time you refill the machine.

#### Cleaning

Cleaning the machine means clearing out any old candy that fell in the drawer, cleaning up any dust that might have collected, and possibly checking that the candy left in the bays (if any) is still fresh.
