## Installation Precautions

## 1\.		1.	Upon receiving the machine, inspect the body, glass, and anchor (wheels) for any damage. Verify that all accessories are present.

## 1. The machine contains a cooling device. To allow it to settle, transport it upright and connect it to the power supply at least 2 hours after unpacking and installation.
## 2. Due to the steel construction of the machine body, entrust professional personnel with installation and relocation to prevent personal injury and machine damage.
## 3. Ensure the installation surface is hard and level. Improper installation can result in tilting, electric shock, fire, or burns.
## 4. 5.	Choose a level installation surface, ensuring the equipment remains vertical with a maximum inclination of 5% (approximately 2°) on all sides.
5. The installation location must be protected from moisture and rain to prevent electrical shorts and circuit board damage from water ingress.
6. Avoid placing the machine in direct heat to ensure proper ventilation and cooling for optimal refrigeration.
7. Keep the machine free from moisture, dust, and dirt, and ensure the ventilation grid remains unobstructed.
8. Maintain a minimum clearance of 40cm between the rear of the machine and any wall, and at least 20cm between multiple machines. Ensure the door can open to at least 135° for good performance and easy loading.
9. Do not attempt to disassemble or modify the equipment without guidance from qualified personnel to prevent accidents.
10. The installation area requires a stable, grounded three-hole power socket supplying 220V mains voltage, depending on the model and region. Do not ground the machine through gas pipes, water pipes, telephone lines, or lightning rods. The grounding resistance should be less than 4 Ω.
11. Verify that the power supply specifications are compatible with the machine before connecting.
12. Install the power socket in an easily accessible location to allow for quick disconnection from the power supply.
13. Do not use damaged power cords or extension cords to avoid electrical leakage and potential injury.
14. If the power cord (Y connection) is damaged, it must be replaced by the manufacturer, their service agent, or similarly qualified personnel to prevent hazards.
15. Ensure the power supply wiring is secure and stable, as poor connections can negatively impact the machine's performance.
16. Do not place flammable materials inside the machine to prevent the risk of fire or explosion.
17. In the event of unusual burning smells, smoke, or fire, immediately unplug the machine and contact the support team or qualified maintenance personnel.
18. If the machine malfunctions, provide photos of the front and the machine code when contacting after-sales service for efficient part identification and troubleshooting.
19. Always disconnect the power supply before replacing parts or performing cleaning and maintenance to prevent electric shock or damage to the machine.
