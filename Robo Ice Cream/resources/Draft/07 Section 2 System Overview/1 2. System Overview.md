**2\. System Overview**

**What Is the Sweet Robo - Robo Ice Cream Machine?**

The Sweet Robo - **Robo Ice Cream Machine** is a fully automated soft-serve vending system designed for unmanned operation in retail environments. It handles everything from order selection and payment to cup dispensing, flavor mixing, and serving — all while maintaining food safety and hygiene standards.

Sweet Robo machines combine **refrigeration**, **mechanical robotics**, and **touchscreen controls** into a compact, user-friendly unit that requires minimal daily oversight.

**Differences Between F1 and F2**

The core system is the same between both models, with a key difference in hopper quantity and flavor control.

| Feature | F1 | F2 |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Ice Cream Flavors  | 1 Flavor  | 2 Flavors + Mixed Swirl (3rd Option) |
| Ice Cream Hoppers  | 1 Hopper  | 2 Hoppers (Left and Right) |
| Customer Flavor Options  | Single option only  | First Flavor / Second Flavor / Mixed |
| Use Case Focus  | Single-flavor product launches  | High-traffic or variety-based operations |

⚠️ All other systems (cup dispenser, backend UI, payment, topping/syrup functionality) are **identical** unless otherwise stated.

**System Design Philosophy**

Sweet Robo machines are engineered for:

•	**Hygienic food handling** (NSF-style contact zones)

•	**Efficient unattended service**

•	**Consistent operator experience** between models

•	**Expandable components** (coin dispenser, flavor count, etc.)

•	**Self-diagnosing behavior** for common faults
