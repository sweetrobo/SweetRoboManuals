**7\. Startup & Loading**

Before activating the Robo Ice Cream machine for regular use, operators must complete a one-time startup procedure. This section covers powering on the machine, flushing internal components, and loading consumables such as mix, syrup, and toppings.

‚∏ª

**Power-On Sequence**

1\.	**Connect the power cord** to a grounded outlet or transformer (see Section 5 for electrical requirements).

2\.	**Ensure the breaker switch is OFF.**

3\.	Visually verify that:

‚Ä¢	Internal components are connected and secured.

‚Ä¢	No obstructions remain in moving areas.

4\.	Turn the **breaker switch ON**.

5\.	Flip the **Main I/O switch ON** to activate the refrigeration and motor systems.


‚ö†Ô∏è The machine may take **2‚Äì8 minutes** to reach optimal temperature for freezing. Ice cream cannot be dispensed until the target internal temperature is reached. You can monitor the temperature from the settings (see section 8)

Pictured is the **main** **breaker switch** on the left and the **main I/O switch** on the right. Both are in the OFF position and will need to be flipped to start the machine.

**Flushing the Hoppers**

Before first use, the ice cream hoppers must be sanitized.

1\.	Open the hopper lids.

2\.	Pour approximately **2 liters of warm water** into each hopper.

3\.	Use a food-safe sanitizing solution to wipe down the interior.

4\.	Rinse with clean warm water.

5\.	Use the **manual discharge function** (see Device Testing in Section 8) to empty the chambers.

6\.	Wipe dry with a clean cloth.

‚úÖ This step removes residue from production and ensures hygienic first use.

‚∏ª

**Loading Ice Cream Mix**

1\.	Open the hopper lid(s).

2\.	Pour the prepared mix into the hopper. Minimum: **2 liters per hopper**.

3\.	Close the lid securely.

üí° Recommended: Mix preparation should follow product instructions. *See* ***Section 12: Preparing Ice Cream Mix*** *for proper preparation instructions.*

‚∏ª

**Adjusting the Refill Tube**

The refill tube controls how much mix flows into the freezing chamber after each serving.
