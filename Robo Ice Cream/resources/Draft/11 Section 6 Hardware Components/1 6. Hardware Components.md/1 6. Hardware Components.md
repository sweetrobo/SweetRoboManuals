6\. Hardware Components

The Robo Ice Cream machine consists of multiple physical systems, divided into external (customer-facing) and internal (operator-only) components. A clear understanding of these parts is essential for installation, operation, and maintenance.

External Components (Customer-Facing)

Pictured is the External view of Robo Ice Cream 

These components are designed for direct use by customers, including children, without needing assistance or supervision.

| Component | Description |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| Touchscreen  | Customer interface for selecting flavors, toppings, and completing payment.  |
| Cup Dispenser  | Dispenses one cup per order using sensor-guided motor control.  |
| Collection Door  | Opens only when the soft serve is ready. Equipped with sensors to detect cup presence. Remains open while the cup is inside and automatically closes once the cup is removed.  |
| Speaker  | Plays audio feedback and video content during the ordering and vending process. (Placed inside screen)  |
| Touch Screen  | Shows advertisements, preparation animations, and system messages.  |

✅ The dispensing door is the only physical opening accessible to the customer. It is controlled and monitored to prevent tampering, accidental contact, or unsafe access.

Internal Components (Operator-Only)

Door Solenoid:

This mechanism controls the output door of the Robo Ice Cream. It automatically opens when a serving is ready and safely closes once it detects the area is clear.

Cash Box:

Securely stores paper currency collected from customer payments. Be sure to use a lock for added safety and easy access when collecting cash.

Speaker:

Plays audio for videos and the main system.

Touch Screen:

A user-friendly interface that lets customers easily place their orders with just a few taps.

Coin Change Box:

Holds coins received during cash payments. Easily accessible for collection and maintenance.

Coin Dispenser (Optional Add-on):

If equipped, this dispenser returns change to customers using coins. Make sure to load it with at least 100 coins to ensure smooth operation.

Timer:  
 This hardware timer controls the power supply to the entire machine. Unlike software-based timers, it operates independently of the system’s software. When activated, it cuts all power to the machine, immediately halting every operation. You can program it (see “Programming Hours of Operation” in X section) to align with your desired working hours.

Controls power to the **entire machine**. Unlike software-based timers, this is a **physical hardware component** that operates independently of the touchscreen or backend interface. When activated, it cuts off all electrical power, immediately halting all functions. Use with extreme caution to make sure ice cream mix does not spoil due to timer shut-offs.

✅ We recommend to use the software timer in the backend settings (see Section 8).

See **Section X: Timer Configuration** for setup instructions.

Breaker / Power Switch:  
 Acts as the **primary power cutoff**. Flipping this switch OFF completely disconnects the machine from power — no components will function.

⚠️ Always turn off the breaker before performing internal maintenance or transport. 

Main I/O Power Switch:

![][RoboIceCream-MainIOswitch]

  
 Controls power to the **internal refrigeration system** and the **ice cream dispensing mechanism**. Turning this switch OFF disables freezing and serving functions but **leaves the touchscreen and other electronics active**.

⚠️ Only use this switch when the hoppers are **empty** or you are performing a **cleaning cycle**.

Leaving this OFF with mix still in the machine can cause **spoilage** or **bacterial growth** and **health risks**.

Cup Holder / Dispenser:  
 Motorized system that stores and drops cups into position during customer orders. 

* •	**4 cup tubes total** (standard on both F1 and F2)
* •	**50 cups per tube**, for a **total capacity of 200 cups**

✅ Refill cups as needed. Ensure cups are loaded neatly and are not stuck or deformed.

Ice Cream Hopper(s):   
  At the heart of the machine we have refrigerated hoppers that store liquid mix before freezing. These keep the mix perfectly cool and ready for smooth, creamy dispensing every time. 

* **F1:** Has 1 hopper
* **F2:** Has 2 hoppers (Left & Right)
* **Capacity per hopper:** 2L minimum, 12L maximum

✅ Always check mix level before startup. Never run the machine with an empty hopper.

Syrup Holders:   
 Add a burst of flavor! Stores and supplies up to **3 types of liquid syrup** (e.g. chocolate, strawberry, caramel).

* Capacity: *(fill in exact volume if known)*
* Syrups are gravity-fed into the syrup dispenser system.

⚠️ Use only **approved liquid syrups**. Do not load solids or thick pastes.

Dry Topping Containers:   
 Top it off in style! Holds up to **3 types of solid toppings** (e.g. sprinkles, crushed cookies, chopped nuts).

* Capacity: **270g per hopper**
* Toppings are dispensed automatically at the final stage of preparation.

⚠️ Use only **approved dry toppings.** Do not load sticky, moist, or powdered ingredients.

Topping Dispenser:  
 Dispenses dry toppings directly onto the ice cream as the final step before serving. Coordinates with the delivery bot and cup sensors.

UV Sanitizer:

A built-in **ultraviolet light** sterilizes the dispense area between servings to maintain hygiene.

✅ Can be tested manually through the backend interface. See Section 8.

Syrup Dispenser:  
 Mechanism that draws liquid syrup from the syrup holders and applies it to the ice cream as per the customer’s selection.

Ice Cream Dispenser:  
 This is where Blue Robo collects the freshly dispensed ice cream into a cup before moving on to toppings and syrups—bringing your dessert to life.

✅ The dispenser is synchronized with internal temperature and mix level sensors to ensure optimal flow.


These components are accessed by trained staff via the secured cabinet panels and should never be exposed to untrained users.
