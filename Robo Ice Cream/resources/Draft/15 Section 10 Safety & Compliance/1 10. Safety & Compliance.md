10\. Safety & Compliance

The Robo Ice Cream machine is designed with multiple safeguards to ensure the safety of operators, customers, and the surrounding environment. Proper installation, operation, and maintenance are essential for meeting food safety and equipment certification standards.

‚∏ª

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Operator Responsibility

Only trained staff should:

* Open machine panels or internal compartments
* Refill or replace internal components (e.g., hoppers, syrup, toppings)
* Perform cleaning or servicing tasks
* Access backend diagnostic settings

üö´ Customers or untrained individuals must **never** interact with the machine‚Äôs internals.

‚∏ª

### Customer Safety

The machine is designed to be safe for public interaction, including use by children. Key features include:

* **Touchscreen-Only Interface**: Customers interact solely through a sealed touchscreen interface.
* **Automatic Collection Door**: Opens only when a cup is ready and closes automatically after the cup is removed.
* **Door Sensors**: Prevent the door from closing while a cup is present.
* **No Exposed Moving Parts**: All internal mechanisms are fully enclosed and inaccessible to users.

‚∏ª

### Physical Safety

#### Automatic Door Maintenance

Before performing any maintenance on the automatic collection door, **power must be turned off**. If testing or debugging with power on, use extreme caution to avoid **pinch hazards** or injury from moving components.

#### Machine Wheels

The machine is **not designed for relocation via rolling**. Transporting it across distances may damage the wheels. If a wheel must be replaced:

* Use certified lifting equipment.
* Do **not** tilt or lay the machine on its side‚Äîthis can lead to major structural or internal damage.

‚∏ª

### Electrical Safety

#### General Maintenance & Safety Guidelines

#### ‚Ä¢		‚Ä¢	Always use the backend **software shutdown button** to power down the internal PC before disconnecting power or turing off the main breaker.

* ‚Ä¢	Always **disconnect all power sources** before performing maintenance.
* Only personnel with appropriate electrical knowledge should service the machine.
* Never unplug the machine while it is powered on.
* Use the **Breaker Switch** to safely isolate the system.

‚ö†Ô∏è Unauthorized repairs or alterations may **void the warranty**. Always contact **Sweet Robo support** for approval before making internal changes.

Sweet Robo recommends notifying a certified technician before performing service or repairs.

#### Auto Shut-Off Behavior

The machine includes several built-in safety triggers:

* Hopper temperature sensors monitor cold-holding conditions. If the internal mix rises above **41¬∞F (5¬∞C)**, it is considered expired and dispensing will be blocked until it is replaced and sanitized.
* Internal temperature sensors
* Dispenser malfunctions
* Hardware stalls or failure conditions

When triggered:

* Dispensing, cooling, and motor systems shut down automatically
* The touchscreen may remain powered for diagnosis
* Logs of the event are stored for technician review

Always resolve the root issue before restarting the machine.

‚∏ª

### UV Sanitation System

A UV-C light is integrated into the dispensing area to help neutralize bacteria between sessions.

* Avoid direct eye exposure to the UV light during manual tests.
* The system activates only when the door is closed.
* Manual cleaning is still required; UV is a **supplement**, not a replacement.

‚∏ª

### Appearance & Surface Cleaning

Routine cleaning is essential for both hygiene and presentation.

#### Approved Cleaning Agents

Use only approved cleaning solutions to avoid damage and maintain compliance:

‚úÖ **Safe to Use:**

* Warm water with **neutral detergent**
* Mild dish soap (e.g., Dawn)
* Food-safe sanitizer (such as a certified quaternary ammonium-based product approved for food contact surfaces)
* 70% isopropyl alcohol (for cleaning the touchscreen and outer surfaces)

‚ùå **Do Not Use:**

* Paint thinner
* Volatile oils
* Bleach or alkaline cleaners
* Abrasive powders or scouring pads
* Acetone or solvent-based chemicals

These substances may corrode plastics, strip protective coatings, or damage sensitive components.

**Recommended Cleaning Frequency:**

* **Wipe-down**: Every 3 days
* **Deep cleaning**: Every 7‚Äì10 days

‚∏ª

### Inspection & Regulatory Compliance

To meet NAMA and food safety requirements:

* Keep a written log of every cleaning, topping refill, and hopper refill
* Ensure documentation is readily available for inspection
* Contact Sweet Robo support for certification documents as needed

The machine‚Äôs cold-holding zones, sensor systems, and sanitation protocols are designed to comply with U.S. food safety regulations and vending industry standards.

Cold-Holding System Details (NAMA Compliance)

Freezing System Overview

The machine uses a compressor-driven freezing unit to maintain proper food-safe temperatures for the ice cream mix stored in the hopper(s). Each model has dedicated components and insulation to stabilize internal temperature during both operation and idle hours.

‚Ä¢	**Cooling Type:** Direct-contact evaporator plate

‚Ä¢	**Refrigerant:** R290 (Eco-friendly, compliant with food equipment standards)

‚Ä¢	**Insulation:** High-density polyurethane foam

‚Ä¢	**Rated Cooling Output:**

‚Ä¢‚ÄÉF1: \~350W

‚Ä¢‚ÄÉF2: \~500W combined

Sensor Monitoring

Each hopper contains a calibrated digital temperature sensor that constantly monitors internal temperature.

‚Ä¢	**Accuracy:** ¬±1¬∞F (¬±0.5¬∞C)

‚Ä¢	**Interface:** Real-time display through backend diagnostics

‚Ä¢	**Safety Action:**

‚Ä¢‚ÄÉIf the hopper temperature exceeds 41¬∞F (5¬∞C), the system:

‚Äì Blocks all dispensing

‚Äì Flags the product as expired

‚Äì Displays a safety notice to the operator
