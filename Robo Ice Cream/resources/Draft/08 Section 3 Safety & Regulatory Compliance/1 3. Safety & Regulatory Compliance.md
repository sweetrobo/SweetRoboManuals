**3\. Safety & Regulatory Compliance**

**General Safety Overview**

Operating the Robo Ice Cream machine safely requires strict adherence to electrical, food, and mechanical safety standards. This machine is built for commercial use and should only be operated by trained personnel.

Improper handling can result in personal injury, damage to the unit, or invalidation of the warranty.


⸻

**User Roles**

The Robo Ice Cream machine is designed for **two distinct types of users**:

•	**Customer Users**: Any member of the public — including children — who interacts with the machine via the touchscreen to place and pay for an order. This interaction is safe, guided, and limited to external controls only.

•	**Operators / Authorized Staff**: Trained personnel responsible for machine setup, internal access, maintenance, troubleshooting, and sanitation. These users must understand both the mechanical and food safety protocols outlined in this manual.

⚠️ **Only operators** may open the machine cabinet, access internal components, or modify hardware or system settings.

⸻

**Operator Responsibility**

Operators must:

•	Follow all cleaning and maintenance schedules

•	Keep all protective covers and guards in place

•	Avoid bypassing safety interlocks or sensors

•	Disconnect power before servicing or cleaning

•	Use only approved consumables and replacement parts

⸻

**Electrical Safety**

•	Ensure the power supply matches machine specifications: **110V–125V, 30A** or  **220-240V, 15A** (depending on region and model)

•	Use a grounded 3-prong outlet. Never bypass grounding.

•	Never operate near water or in wet environments.

•	Do not use damaged cords or extension cables.

•	Unplug the unit only after switching off the **breaker** (not during operation).

•	Do not open electrical panels unless trained.

**Important:** All electrical work must comply with local codes. Certification bodies may inspect for proper grounding and power isolation.

⸻

**Mechanical Safety**

•	Never insert hands or tools into moving parts during operation.

•	Ensure the **automatic door sensor** is functioning before each day’s operation.

•	Do not allow children or untrained staff near the machine while it is active.

•	Always power off before refilling internal components.

•	Cup and topping jams must be cleared with the machine powered down.

⸻

**Food Safety Compliance**

The Robo Ice Cream machine is designed with food-contact safety in mind:

•	All hoppers, tubes, and serving components must be **food-grade certified**

•	Internal surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized on a scheduled basis (see Section 9)

•	Operators must discard expired or contaminated mix

•	No foreign materials may enter the hoppers or topping areas

Use only **liquid syrups** and **solid, dry toppings**. Do not use sauces, jams with solids, or unapproved additives.

⸻

**UV Sterilization Notes**

Each machine is equipped with a UV lamp inside the dispensing chamber:

•	This lamp is intended to reduce bacterial load at the nozzle

•	It is not a substitute for regular manual cleaning

•	UV operation can be manually tested via the device backend

•	Always allow the lamp to cool before touching

⸻

**Physical Placement Requirements**

•	Keep the machine on a **level, hard floor**

•	Allow **at least 50 cm** (20 inches) of clearance behind the unit

•	Do not block ventilation grilles or rear exhaust

•	Maintain **at least 20 cm** between machines if placed side by side

•	Ensure the door can open to **at least 135°**

**Caution:** Do not tilt, lay down, or roll the machine over rough surfaces. Use proper lifting equipment if relocation is needed.

⸻

**Hardware Clock & Operation Hours**

The Robo Ice Cream uses a **physical hardware timer** to control its daily operating hours. This timer is:

•	Independent of the software system

•	Located inside the machine cabinet

•	Adjustable via dedicated hardware buttons

Operators must configure the timer during setup. Improper settings may result in the machine not powering on during expected hours.

⸻

**Certification-Ready Safety Labels**

The machine includes labeling for:

•	Electrical input ratings

•	Manufacturer and model identification

•	Serial number and date of production

•	Safety warning symbols (moving parts, pinch hazard, electrical hazard)

If a label becomes damaged or unreadable, it must be replaced before the machine returns to service.
