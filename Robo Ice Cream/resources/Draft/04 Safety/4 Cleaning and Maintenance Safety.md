## Cleaning and Maintenance Safety

* ⚠️ **CAUTION: Risk of minor injury or equipment damage.**
* **Disconnect Power First:** **ALWAYS** disconnect the Robo Ice Cream from the electrical outlet before performing any cleaning or maintenance tasks.
* **Cool Down:** If any components become warm during operation (e.g., motors), allow them to cool down before cleaning or touching.
* **Protective Measures:**
    * Wear appropriate protective gear if recommended for specific cleaning tasks (e.g., gloves).
    * Avoid loose clothing, jewelry, or long hair that could get caught in any moving parts if internal access is required.
    * Be mindful of potential electrostatic discharge (ESD) when working near electronic components. Consider using an ESD wrist strap if servicing internal electronics.
* **Approved Cleaning Materials:** Use only cleaning agents and materials recommended by the manufacturer. Do not use abrasive cleaners, solvents, or harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces or internal components. Unless instructed to do so by Sweet Robo support staff.
* **Boiling Water:** Read the cleaning instructions before using boiling water, only used where appropriate.
