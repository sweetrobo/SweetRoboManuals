F2 Model Installation Support Chat

Initial Setup After Unboxing:

Customer: I just unboxed this machine and I have no clue what to do next?

Support: If you want to install the top lights, we can start with that. With the machine off, you can install the 4 panels (or however many you prefer). It's completely up to you how many panels you want or if you even want them installed.

Customer: Yes, I want all of the panels!

Support: Perfect! Let's get you started:
1. There are 4 screws that need to be screwed down to the base
2. Use the connection bracket to stabilize the panels together with a screw and nut
3. After connecting the panels to the base, connect the wires on top to the wires from the base (black to black, red to red)

Troubleshooting Core Board Error:

Customer: Perfect, I turned it on and got an error message - "Core board error"? What happened?

Support: Did you turn on the machine without turning on the hopper?

Customer: Yes.

Support: And no liquid material in the hopper?

Customer: Yes?

Support: This error happens because the hopper is turned off and needs liquid. Without liquid-

Customer: Yeah, it's making a loud noise!

Support: Yes! This happens because there's no lubrication from the liquid in the hopper, so it's metal hitting against metal. Here's what to do:
1. Turn off the machine
2. Fill the hopper with gelato mix (3 liters of water and a gelato mix packet)
3. Turn on the hopper switch (located on the bottom of the hopper)
4. Turn on the machine
The error should go away.

Customer: Yes, it went away!


Nayax Payment System Setup:

Customer: How do I set up Nayax here?

Support: There's a slot for the Nayax reader located behind the cash box:
1. Remove the zip tie
2. Unscrew the panel to place your Nayax reader inside
3. The Nayax needs a marshal cover
4. Connect COM2 to the machine to enable the reader
Note: If you get an error message and haven't finished registration with Nayax, you'll need to contact them.

Machine Configuration:

Support: I want to confirm your machine is working properly:
1. Access the backend by tapping and holding the top-right corner of the touchscreen
2. Enter code: 123456 (we can change it if you'd like)
3. Go to Parameter Settings
4. On the left side, find the ice cream options: "Clean", "Cool", "Thaw"
5. Select "Cooling" to begin the cooling process
6. Exit back to the menu

For WiFi connection:
1. In System Settings, look at the bottom right (it's hard to see)
2. Find 3 buttons: "Exit App", "Restart", "Repair"
3. Press "Exit App" to go to Android settings
4. Connect your WiFi through the android settings
5. Return to the app

Common Additional Questions:

Q: I want to change the toppings on the machine. How can I change it?

A: Yes! Provide your machine ID so I can access the backend remotely. I can make the changes for you - just let me know what you want.

Q: I put the syrup in and it's not dispensing anything?

A: Go to Parameter Settings and look for Syrup 1, 2, 3:
1. Press play/test for each syrup
2. Have a cup ready by the syrup tip
3. Run it a few times until syrup comes out
Note: Sometimes it needs several attempts to come out fully.

Q: How can I change the prices of ice cream and toppings?

A: This can be done two ways:
- Through the machine's "Product Management" settings
- Remotely by support (we can also change product images)

Q: How often should I change the ice cream mix?

A: The ice cream mix should be changed every 3-4 days after pouring. Important notes:
- Keep an eye on the hopper if you exceed the recommended time
- The gelato can spoil after this period
- Spoiled mix takes extra time to clean out properly
