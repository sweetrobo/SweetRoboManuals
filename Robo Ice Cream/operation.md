# Operation Guide

The Robo Ice Cream F2 features **dual hoppers** enabling customers to enjoy two distinct flavors simultaneously or create exciting swirl combinations. This guide covers customer operation, operator management, and the unique dual-flavor capabilities of the F2 system.

## F2 Dual-Flavor System Overview

The F2's advanced dual-hopper design allows for:
- **Left Hopper**: Primary flavor (chocolate, vanilla, etc.)
- **Right Hopper**: Secondary flavor (strawberry, mint, etc.)
- **Swirl Mode**: Combines both flavors for unique taste experiences
- **Independent Temperature Control**: Each hopper maintains optimal serving temperature

## Daily Startup Procedure

1. **Check Machine Status**
   - Verify power is on
   - Check **L: and R:** temperature displays (should show 100% when ready)
   - Ensure both hoppers are at serving temperature
   - Verify all doors are closed properly

2. **Verify Dual-Hopper Supplies**
   - Check ice cream mix levels in **both hoppers** (minimum 2L per hopper)
   - Ensure different flavors are properly loaded in Left and Right hoppers
   - Check cup inventory in all 4 tubes
   - Verify syrup levels for flavor enhancement
   - Check topping levels for complete customization

3. **Backend Access and System Check**
   - Tap and hold top-right corner for 3-5 seconds
   - Enter password: 123456
   - Check system status for both hoppers
   - Verify no alerts for either Left or Right systems

## Ice Cream Mix Preparation - F2 Dual-Hopper System

### Preparing Powder-Based Mix

For optimal F2 operation, prepare mix for each hopper independently:

**Required Tools:**
- Mixing bucket (at least 5L capacity)
- Food-safe electric mixer or whisk
- Clean stirring rod
- Fresh drinking-grade water

<img src="./assets/maintenance/mixing-bucket.webp" alt="Mixing Equipment" class="maintenance-image" />
*Required tools for preparing ice cream mix*

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Water Base**
   - Pour **4 liters of fresh water** into clean mixing bucket
   - Ensure bucket is sanitized and dry before use

2. **Add Ice Cream Powder**
   - Slowly pour **one full 1.5 kg bag** of powder into water
   - Allow brief settling time for initial dissolution

<img src="./assets/maintenance/mix-preparation-step-1.webp" alt="Adding Powder" class="maintenance-image" />
*Adding ice cream powder to water base*

3. **Mix Thoroughly**
   - Use mixer to stir solution for **2–3 minutes**
   - Ensure slurry is smooth and clump-free
   - Avoid over-mixing to prevent excess foaming

<img src="./assets/maintenance/mix-preparation-step-2.webp" alt="Mixing Process" class="maintenance-image" />
*Proper mixing technique for smooth consistency*

4. **Transfer to Hopper**
   - Slowly pour mixed slurry into designated hopper (Left or Right)
   - Avoid splashing or overfilling
   - Keep hopper lids closed after refilling

5. **Quality Check**
   - Light foam layer above liquid is normal
   - Gently stir with clean rod if excess foam develops
   - Verify proper consistency before operation

### F2 Dual-Hopper Fill Guidelines

**Initial Setup:**
- For new startups or after full cleaning, add **at least 2 full bags per hopper** (6 kg total powder to 16 L water)
- This ensures both hoppers are properly primed for dual-flavor operation

**Ongoing Refills:**
- Maintain minimum 2L in each hopper for consistent operation
- Stir remaining mix before refilling to prevent settling
- Alternate hopper refills to maintain continuous dual-flavor availability

**Flavor Management:**
- Use different flavors in each hopper for maximum customer choice
- Popular combinations: Vanilla (Left) + Chocolate (Right)
- Consider seasonal flavors: Vanilla (Left) + Strawberry (Right)

⚠️ Always sanitize all equipment between flavor changes to prevent cross-contamination

## Temperature Monitoring - Dual-Hopper System

The F2's dual display system shows individual hopper status:

- **L: 100%** = Left hopper at optimal serving temperature
- **R: 100%** = Right hopper at optimal serving temperature  
- **Lower percentages** = Cooling in progress for that hopper
- **Alert conditions** = Temperature issues requiring attention

Both hoppers must reach 100% for full dual-flavor operation. Single-hopper operation possible if one hopper is offline.

## Managing Dual Flavors During Operation

### Flavor Rotation Strategy

To maximize customer satisfaction and manage inventory:

1. **Popular Combinations**
   - Vanilla + Chocolate (classic appeal)
   - Vanilla + Strawberry (fruit combination)
   - Chocolate + Mint (premium experience)

2. **Seasonal Considerations**
   - Summer: Light flavors (vanilla, strawberry)
   - Winter: Rich flavors (chocolate, caramel)
   - Holidays: Themed combinations

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Monitor consumption rates per hopper
   - Adjust mix preparation based on customer preferences
   - Track swirl vs. single-flavor selections

### Refilling During Operation

**Ice Cream Mix - Dual-Hopper Process:**
1. Check which hopper requires refilling (L: or R: display)
2. Prepare mix according to instructions above
3. Open specific hopper lid carefully
4. Add prepared mix without disturbing other hopper
5. Verify minimum 2L level maintained in both hoppers
6. Close lid securely and verify temperature recovery

**Coordinated Refilling:**
- Plan refills during low-traffic periods
- Never refill both hoppers simultaneously
- Maintain at least one hopper operational during refills

### Syrups & Toppings for F2

The F2's enhanced customization options include:
- **3 Syrup Options**: Chocolate, strawberry, caramel (typical)
- **3 Topping Options**: Sprinkles, nuts, chocolate chips (typical)
- **Flavor Pairing**: Certain syrups complement specific hopper flavors

Replace syrup bags and refill topping containers as needed, using only approved products that complement the dual-flavor system.
