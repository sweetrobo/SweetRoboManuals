# Setup & Installation

## Pre-Installation Checklist

Before starting setup, ensure you have:
- F2 machine delivered and inspected for damage
- Required power supply: **220V dedicated circuit** (20A breaker minimum)
- All included accessories: tool kit, cleaning kit, cups, power cord
- Ice cream mix packets and 3 liters of water per hopper
- Syrups and toppings ready for installation

## Step 1: Unpacking and Initial Inspection

### 1.1 Exterior Inspection
- Check outer packaging for visible damage
- Verify Model (F2), Serial Number, and Delivery Date
- Photograph any damage before unboxing

### 1.2 Interior Inspection
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Do NOT power on the machine until this inspection is complete

- Open all cabinet doors
- Check for loose parts, connectors, or tubing that may have shifted during transit
- Remove ALL packaging materials (foam, tape, plastics, zip-ties) from:
  - Cup holder assembly
  - Door mechanism
  - Hopper outlets
  - Any mechanical areas
- Verify all internal cables and components are properly connected

### 1.3 Positioning Requirements
- Place on stable, level surface that can support 380 kg
- Ensure minimum clearances:
  - Rear wall: 30 cm
  - Side clearance: 30 cm
  - Front: 120 cm (door swing clearance)
- Surface must be hard and level (no soft mats or carpet)

## Step 2: LED Panel Installation (Optional)

The F2 comes with 4 LED panels that can be installed on top. Installation is optional based on your preference.

**Note:** This must be done with the machine OFF

1. Locate the 4 LED panels and mounting hardware
2. Install the base mounting:
   - Attach 4 screws to secure the base
3. Connect panels together:
   - Use connection brackets to stabilize panels
   - Secure with provided screws and nuts
4. Wire connection:
   - Connect wires from panels to machine base
   - Match colors: **black to black, red to red**
5. Verify all connections are secure

## Step 3: Power Connection

### F2 Power Requirements:
- **220V dedicated power source required**
- 20A circuit breaker minimum
- Proper grounding essential
- Do NOT share circuit with other equipment

### If only 110V available:
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** F2 is designed for 220V. Using 110V requires:
- Professional-grade step-up transformer
- Minimum 3,000W continuous output rating
- Dedicated circuit capable of supporting required amperage

## Step 4: Critical First Start - Avoiding Core Board Error

**üö® MOST IMPORTANT STEP:** The #1 setup error is powering on without ice cream mix, causing the "core board error"

### Why This Happens:
- The auger mechanism requires liquid lubrication
- Without mix, metal grinds on metal causing damage
- Machine will display "Core board error" and make loud grinding noise

### Correct Startup Sequence:

1. **BEFORE powering on:**
   - Prepare ice cream mix: 3 liters water + 1 gelato packet per hopper
   - Fill each hopper with minimum 2 liters of prepared mix
   - Turn ON the hopper switches (located on bottom of each hopper)

2. **THEN power on the machine:**
   - Turn on main power switch
   - Machine should start normally without errors

### If Core Board Error Occurs:
1. **Immediately turn OFF the machine**
2. Fill hoppers with prepared mix (minimum 2L each)
3. Turn ON hopper switches
4. Power on machine - error should clear

## Step 5: Initial Component Setup

### 5.1 Clean Hoppers Before First Use
1. Pour 2 liters warm water into each hopper
2. Access backend (tap top-right corner, enter: 123456)
3. Run cleaning cycle to flush system
4. Drain and wipe dry with food-safe cloth

### 5.2 Load Cups
1. Open front cabinet door
2. Lift cup holder lid
3. Load cups into all 4 tubes (50 cups per tube)
4. Ensure cups are properly aligned
5. Close lid securely

### 5.3 Add Ice Cream Mix
1. Mix preparation: 3L water + 1 gelato packet
2. Open hopper lid
3. Pour minimum 2L into each hopper
4. Close lid securely
5. Ensure hopper switches are ON

### 5.4 Install Syrups
1. Open syrup compartment
2. Connect syrup bags to tubes
3. Hang bags inverted for proper flow
4. **Important:** Only liquid syrups - NO thick sauces

### 5.5 Add Toppings
1. Open topping compartments
2. Pour dry toppings (max 270g per compartment)
3. **Important:** Only dry toppings - NO liquids or chunks

## Step 6: System Configuration

### 6.1 Access Backend
1. Tap and hold top-right corner of touchscreen for 3-5 seconds
2. Enter password: **123456**
3. Main settings menu will appear

### 6.2 Start Cooling Process
1. Navigate to Parameter Settings
2. Find ice cream options: "Clean", "Cool", "Thaw"
3. Select **"Cooling"** to begin
4. Allow 5-10 minutes for proper cooling
5. Screen will show L: % and R: % (100% = ready)

### 6.3 Prime Syrup Lines
1. In Parameter Settings, find Syrup 1, 2, 3
2. Place cup under syrup nozzle
3. Press test/play for each syrup
4. Run multiple times until syrup flows smoothly
5. Air bubbles are normal initially

## Step 7: Payment System Setup
