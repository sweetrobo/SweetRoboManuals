### 1.4 Positioning Requirements
The F2 machine must be installed on a stable, level surface in a clean, dry indoor environment.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Two or more people required** for safely moving and positioning the machine. Use appropriate lifting equipment if necessary.

**Floor Requirements:**
- Must support **380 kg** (848 lbs) + ice cream mix weight
- Surface must be hard and level (no soft mats or carpet)
- Do not tilt, rock, or roll the machine once upright

**Minimum Clearances:**
| Location | Required Distance |
|----------|------------------|
| Rear wall | 50 cm (20 in) minimum |
| Side-to-side | 20 cm (8 in) minimum |
| Front (door) | Must open to 135¬∞+ |

**Environment Requirements:**
- Indoor use only
- Avoid direct sunlight or excessive heat
- Avoid high humidity areas
- Ensure stable WiFi signal or accessible Ethernet port nearby

## Step 2: LED Panel Installation (Optional)

The F2 comes with 4 LED panels that can be installed on top. Installation is optional based on your preference.

**Note:** This must be done with the machine OFF

1. Locate the 4 LED panels and mounting hardware
2. Install the base mounting:
   - Attach 4 screws to secure the base
3. Connect panels together:
   - Use connection brackets to stabilize panels
   - Secure with provided screws and nuts
4. Wire connection:
   - Connect wires from panels to machine base
   - Match colors: **black to black, red to red**
5. Verify all connections are secure

## Step 3: Power Connection

### F2 Power Requirements:
The Robo Ice Cream F2 **must be connected to a dedicated 220V power source**.

**Electrical Specifications:**
- **220-240V AC** dedicated outlet  
- **13A for 220V circuit** minimum (refer to Technical Specifications for exact requirements)
- **Properly grounded** electrical outlet matching machine voltage
- **Do NOT share** the circuit with other appliances
- Highly recommended to use circuit with **surge protection**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Electrical Shock Hazard Warning:** Ensure hands are dry and you are not standing in water when connecting the power cord.

### If only 110V available:
**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:** F2 is engineered for 220V operation. Using 110V requires:

- **Step-up transformer** with at least **2,860W continuous output**
- **Dedicated 30A circuit** on the 110V input side (F2 draws ~26A at full load)  
- **Proper grounding and isolation** from other loads
- **Professional installation** recommended

**Using an undersized transformer or shared circuit may result in machine malfunction, tripped breakers, or permanent damage.** Always verify your power source before installation.

## Step 4: Critical First Start - Avoiding Core Board Error

**üö® MOST IMPORTANT STEP:** The #1 setup error is powering on without ice cream mix, causing the "core board error"

### Why This Happens:
- The auger mechanism requires liquid lubrication
- Without mix, metal grinds on metal causing damage
- Machine will display "Core board error" and make loud grinding noise

### Correct Startup Sequence:

1. **BEFORE powering on:**
   - Prepare ice cream mix: 3 liters water + 1 gelato packet per hopper
   - Fill each hopper with minimum 2 liters of prepared mix
   - Turn ON the hopper switches (located on bottom of each hopper)

2. **THEN power on the machine:**
   - Turn on main power switch
   - Machine should start normally without errors

### If Core Board Error Occurs:
1. **Immediately turn OFF the machine**
2. Fill hoppers with prepared mix (minimum 2L each)
3. Turn ON hopper switches
4. Power on machine - error should clear

## Step 5: Initial Component Setup

### 5.1 Clean Hoppers Before First Use
**F2 has 2 hoppers** that must be sanitized before first use:

1. **Pour approximately 2 liters of warm water** into each hopper
2. **Wipe down the interior** using a food-grade sanitizing solution
3. **Rinse thoroughly** with additional warm water
4. **Access backend** (tap top-right corner, enter: 123456)
5. **Use manual discharge function** (see Device Testing section) to empty chambers
6. **Wipe dry** with clean, food-safe cloth

### 5.2 Load Cups (200 Cup Capacity)
The F2 cup dispenser can hold **200 cups total** (50 per tube):

1. **Open the cabinet door** and lift cup storage container lid
2. **Place ice cream cups neatly** into the 4 cup holder tubes (rim up)
3. **Ensure proper alignment** - misaligned cups cause dispensing issues
4. **Load all 4 tubes** for maximum 200 cup capacity
5. **Close the lid securely**

### 5.3 Add Ice Cream Mix (Dual Hopper Loading)
**F2 Features:** Each hopper operates independently, allowing different flavors.

1. **Mix preparation**: 3L water + 1 gelato packet per hopper
2. **Open each hopper lid**
3. **Pour minimum 2 liters** into each hopper (4L total for both hoppers)
4. **Important**: Make sure amount is at least 2L per hopper for proper function
5. **Close lids securely**
6. **Verify hopper switches are ON** (located at bottom of each hopper)

### 5.4 Adjust Refill Tube Settings
The refill tube controls how much mix flows into the freezing chamber after each serving:

**Settings:**
- **0 = Closed**
- **1 = Smallest opening**  
- **2 = Medium** (recommended for standard servings)
- **3 = Fully Open** (for larger portions)

**Recommendation:** Start with setting **2** for most standard servings. Increase for larger portions.

### 5.5 Install Syrups
1. **Open the syrup jar compartment**
2. **Pull out the syrup tube** from the machine
3. **Twist the syrup bag** onto the syrup tube connector, ensuring secure connection
4. **Place syrup bag upside down** so syrup flows from the bottom
5. **Test flow** - syrup should flow smoothly without air bubbles

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements:**
- **Only liquid syrups allowed**
- **NO SOLIDS** - no thick sauces, chunks, or particles

### 5.6 Add Toppings  
1. **Open the lid of the toppings box**
2. **Pour in prepared toppings** (maximum 270g per compartment)
3. **Close lid securely**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements:**
- **Only solid/dry toppings allowed**
- **NO LIQUIDS** - no wet, sticky, or liquid items

### 5.7 Final Hardware Setup
1. **Close all cabinet doors** and secure with keys
2. **Place machine on flat surface** with all four feet firmly on ground
3. **Ensure machine is level** - adjust feet as necessary
4. **Tighten locking collars** on all four feet to prevent wobble
5. **Verify clearances** - ensure doors can open fully and ventilation is adequate
6. **Final inspection** - no tools or foreign objects left inside machine

## Step 6: System Configuration

### 6.1 Initial Power-On Sequence
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Ensure Main Breaker/Power Switch is OFF before connecting power cord.

1. **Connect power cord** securely to grounded 220V electrical outlet
2. **Turn Main Breaker/Master Switch to ON** (located behind cups area, right side access door)
3. **Turn ON the Compressor switch** to start refrigeration system
4. **Observe system initialization:**
   - Touchscreen should illuminate
   - System begins startup sequence (may take several minutes)
   - Watch for any unusual noises or error messages

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The machine may take **2-8 minutes** to reach optimal temperature for freezing. Ice cream cannot be dispensed until target internal temperature is reached.

### 6.2 Access Backend Interface
1. **Tap and hold** top-right corner of touchscreen for 3-5 seconds
2. **Enter password:** **123456**
3. **Main settings menu** will appear

### 6.3 Start Cooling Process
1. **Navigate to Parameter Settings**
2. **Find ice cream options:** "Clean", "Cool", "Thaw"
3. **Select "Cooling"** to begin freezing process
4. **Allow 5-10 minutes** for proper cooling
5. **Monitor progress:** Screen will show L: % and R: % (100% = ready for both hoppers)

### 6.4 Prime Syrup Lines
1. **In Parameter Settings,** find Syrup 1, 2, 3
2. **Place cup under syrup nozzle**
3. **Press test/play** for each syrup
4. **Run multiple times** until syrup flows smoothly
5. **Air bubbles are normal** initially - continue until flow is consistent

## Step 7: Payment System Setup

### Nayax Card Reader Installation
1. Remove zip tie behind cash box
2. Unscrew access panel
3. Install Nayax reader with marshal cover
4. Connect COM2 cable to machine
5. Complete Nayax registration online
