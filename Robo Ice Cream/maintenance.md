# Maintenance

Proper maintenance is critical for the Robo Ice Cream F2's food safety, functionality, and regulatory compliance. The F2 model features **dual hoppers** that must both be maintained according to the same rigorous schedule, with a **200-cup capacity** requiring frequent monitoring.

⚠️ **Important**: Only trained staff should perform internal cleaning. Always shut off ice cream-related systems before starting using the main I/O switch. Never leave mix in hoppers longer than 3 days.

## Daily Cleaning Procedures

Perform these tasks at the end of each operating day:

### External Cleaning
- **Wipe down machine exterior** and touch interface
- **Sanitize touchscreen** and collection door area using food-safe sanitizer
- **Clean viewing window** with soft, damp cloth
- **Inspect** all customer contact points for residue or wear

### Operational Checks
- **Check mix expiration labels** on both hoppers
- **Verify hopper fill levels** for both Hopper A and Hopper B
- **Inspect cup dispenser** for debris or blockages (200-cup capacity requires regular monitoring)
- **Check topping bins and syrup lines** for residue or debris
- **Empty drip tray** if needed
- **Check for error messages** on both hopper systems

### Safety Verification
- Ensure UV sanitizer area is clear of debris
- Verify collection door closes properly
- Check that no mix has leaked onto internal surfaces

## 3-Day Deep Cleaning (Both Hoppers)

**Required every 3 days maximum** - sooner if mix has expired. Both hoppers must be cleaned simultaneously to maintain consistency.

### Pre-Cleaning Safety
1. **Power Down**: Turn off the **Main I/O Power Switch**
2. **Leave Breaker ON** if backend access is needed for testing

### Step-by-Step Dual Hopper Cleaning

#### 1. Empty Both Hoppers
- Manually drain mix from **both Hopper A and Hopper B**
- Run **Thaw Fresh** + **Manual Discharge** on each hopper to flush residues
- Ensure complete drainage from both systems

#### 2. Water Flush System
- Fill **both hoppers** with warm water simultaneously
- Run **Auto Discharge** multiple times on each hopper until water runs clear
- Check that both dispensing lines are fully flushed

#### 3. Sanitize Both Hoppers
- Add food-safe sanitizer to **each hopper** (dairy-approved sanitizer required)
- Run sanitizer cycle for 1-2 cycles on both hoppers
- Drain sanitizer from both systems completely

#### 4. Clean Dispensing Nozzles
- Wipe **all ice cream nozzles** (both hopper lines) with sanitized cloth
- Clean **syrup and topping nozzles** thoroughly
- Use included brushes for narrow dispensing points

#### 5. UV Zone & Door Area
- Wipe down dispensing door and UV sanitization zone with soft cloth
- Avoid alcohol or abrasive cleaners
- Ensure UV lamp housing is clean and unobstructed

#### 6. Final Surface Cleaning
- Wipe down touchscreen, frame, and outer panels
- Clean internal collection area thoroughly
- Verify all surfaces are dry before refilling

## Weekly Maintenance Tasks

Perform these comprehensive maintenance tasks weekly:

### 1. Syrup Line Maintenance
- Disconnect syrup bags and flush lines with warm water
- Use **Test Syrup 1-3** functions to verify line cleanliness
- Reconnect and test dispensing accuracy

### 2. Topping System Cleaning
- Remove and empty all topping hoppers
- Wash with mild soap and warm water
- **Dry completely** before reinstalling to prevent clumping
- Refill with fresh toppings

### 3. System Function Testing
- **Cup Sensor Test**: Insert cup manually, confirm door stays open
- **Door Auto-Close Test**: Remove cup, ensure door closes automatically
- **Cup Dropper Test**: Run **Manual Drop Cup** from backend interface
- Check for jams or misalignment in 200-cup dispensing system

### 4. UV Lamp Inspection
- Use backend to activate UV lamp
- Verify proper illumination
- Replace if not lighting (see troubleshooting section)

### 5. Dual Hopper System Check
- Test temperature sensors in both hoppers
- Verify automatic temperature cutoff (41°F/5°C maximum)
- Check mix level sensors for accuracy

## Cleaning Supplies and Safety

### Approved Cleaning Agents
- **Food-safe sanitizers** approved for dairy machines only
- **Warm water** and neutral detergents
- **Food-grade sanitizers** for hopper cleaning

### Prohibited Substances
- Harsh or corrosive chemicals
- Metal tools or hard brushes
- Alcohol-based cleaners near UV components
- Concentrated cleaning products that may corrode surfaces

### Safety Guidelines
- Use separate tools for food-contact areas and waste zones to prevent cross-contamination
- Never use expired cleaning solutions
- Wear appropriate protective equipment
- Ensure proper ventilation during cleaning

### Cross-Contamination Prevention
- Clean Hopper A and Hopper B systems separately to prevent flavor mixing
- Use designated cleaning tools for each hopper system
- Label cleaning supplies to maintain separation

## Maintenance Logs and Compliance

### Required Documentation
Operators must maintain visible cleaning logs onsite including:

- **Task performed** (specify which hopper when applicable)
- **Date and time** of completion
- **Operator initials** and signature
- **Mix expiration dates** for both hoppers
- **Cleaning agent used** and concentration

### Regulatory Compliance
- Logs support NAMA compliance requirements
- Documentation must be available for health inspections
- Track upcoming cleaning due dates systematically
- Maintain records for minimum required retention period

### Digital Tracking
- Record each cleaning and refill of ice cream mix (both hoppers)
- Log syrup container maintenance
- Document topping container cleaning
- Track 200-cup dispenser performance and refill cycles

## Mix Management (Dual Hopper System)

### F2 Dual Hopper Requirements
- **Shelf life**: 3-4 days maximum after mixing (both hoppers)
- **Storage**: Keep unmixed packets in cool, dry place
- **Mixing ratio**: Always 3L water to 1 packet for each hopper
- **Temperature**: Use room temperature water for mixing
- **Capacity**: Each hopper serves 100 cups (200 total capacity)

### Expiration Management
- **3-day rule**: Mix must be discarded after 3 days in either hopper
- **Temperature monitoring**: Automatic shutoff at 41°F (5°C) for both hoppers
- **Visual inspection**: Check for any discoloration or separation in both hoppers
- **Cross-contamination prevention**: Never mix expired product with fresh mix
