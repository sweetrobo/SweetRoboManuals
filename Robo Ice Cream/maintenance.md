# Maintenance

Proper maintenance is critical for the Robo Ice Cream F2's food safety, functionality, and regulatory compliance. The F2 model features **dual hoppers** that must both be maintained according to the same rigorous schedule, with a **200-cup capacity** requiring frequent monitoring.

<div class="important-box">

**IMPORTANT**

Regular cleaning helps prevent failures and extends machine lifespan. Only trained staff should perform internal cleaning. Always shut off ice cream systems using the Main I/O switch before cleaning (certain maintenance tasks may require power). Never leave mix in hoppers longer than 3 days.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Food Safety Guidelines**
- All cleaning agents must be food-safe and approved for food equipment
- Use only clean water and food-grade cleaning products on components that contact food
- Maintain cleaning logs at all times for regulatory compliance
- Only use food-grade chemicals when cleaning components that come in contact with food

## Electrical Safety During Maintenance

<div class="warning-box">

**WARNING: Electrical Shock Hazard.** Only personnel with appropriate electrical knowledge should service electrical components. Improper handling can cause serious injury or death.

</div>

### Power Management Guidelines

<div class="numbered-steps">

<div>
<div>
<h3>Before Any Maintenance</h3>
• Determine if power is needed for the specific task<br>
• For hopper flushing/cleaning cycles: Keep power ON<br>
• For electrical work: Always disconnect ALL power sources<br>
• Never unplug while machine is powered on
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<h3>Proper Shutdown Procedure</h3>
• Use backend software shutdown button to power down internal PC first<br>
• Turn off Main I/O Power Switch<br>
• Use Breaker Switch to safely isolate system<br>
• Disconnect power cord only after breaker is OFF
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
• Be mindful of ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) when near electronics - static electricity can damage components<br>
• Consider using an ESD wrist strap for internal electronics work<br>
• Allow any warm components (IO boards, motors) to cool before touching<br>
• Never touch IO boards without contacting support first
</div>
</div>

</div>

## Mix Management (Dual Hopper System)

<div class="info-box">

### F2 Dual Hopper Requirements
- **Shelf life**: 3-4 days maximum after mixing (both hoppers)
- **Storage**: Keep unmixed powder bags in cool, dry place
- **Mixing ratio**: Always 3-3.5L water to 1 bag (1.5kg) of powder for each hopper
- **Temperature**: Use room temperature water for mixing
- **Capacity**: Each hopper serves 100 cups (200 total capacity)

</div>

<div class="sidebar-highlight">

<h4>Water Ratio Effects on Consistency</h4>

**3L water (minimum)**: Produces thicker, richer ice cream with more intense flavor and creamier texture. May dispense slightly slower.

**3.5L water (maximum)**: Creates lighter consistency that's easier to dispense, with milder flavor. Yields more servings per bag.

*Adjust within this range based on your customer preferences and local climate conditions.*

</div>

<div class="warning-box">

### Expiration Management
- **3-day rule**: Mix must be discarded after 3 days in either hopper
- **Temperature monitoring**: Automatic shutoff at 41°F (5°C) for both hoppers
- **Visual inspection**: Check for any discoloration or separation in both hoppers
- **Cross-contamination prevention**: Never mix expired product with fresh mix

</div>
