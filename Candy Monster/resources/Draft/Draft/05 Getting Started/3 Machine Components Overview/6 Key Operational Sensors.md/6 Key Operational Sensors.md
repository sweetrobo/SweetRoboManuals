This image shows two critical sensors for the dispensing process:

* **Green Robo Position Sensor:** This specific sensor detects when the Green Robo mechanism is at its home/start position, ready for collection or positioned near the collection door. It is one of several position sensors used to accurately align the **Cup Holder** under the correct **Candy Bay** chute during dispensing.
* **Cup Sensor:** This sensor performs multiple checks: it confirms the presence of a cup in the **Cup Holder** before Green Robo moves to collect candy, ensuring a cup is ready. After dispensing, it also detects when the customer has removed the filled cup from the collection area, signaling that it is safe to close the **Collection Door**.
