Step-by-Step Physical Setup

Each machine is thoroughly tested before leaving the factory. Minimal assembly is required.

⚠️ **CAUTION:** Two or more people may be required for safely moving and positioning the machine. Use appropriate lifting equipment if necessary.

1. **Position the Machine:**
    * Carefully move the Candy Monster to its final operating location, ensuring it meets all site requirements.
    * Ensure all four feet are firmly on the ground and the machine is level.
    * Lock the feet in place when ready.

2. **Initial Internal Inspection & Unpacking:**
    * Unlock and open all service doors.
    * Carefully inspect the interior for any loose wires, plugs, pipes, or components that may have shifted during transit. If any component appears disconnected or damaged, **DO NOT** power on the machine. Contact Sweet Robo customer support for guidance.
    * Remove any internal packaging materials, zip ties (unless they are holding wires that are meant to stay in place), or securing tapes. Pay close attention to the delivery bot area and candy bays to ensure they are clear of obstructions.
    * Locate the accessory kit (screwdriver, extra sensors, etc.) which may be inside the machine.
    * Locate the keys which are attached to the power cord at the back of the machine.

3. **Install the Roof (usually comes pre-installed):**
    * If your shipment arrived without the roof pre-installed, contact customer support for instructions how to install it. 
4. **Install Cups in Dispenser:**
    * Open the right service door providing access to the cup dispenser mechanism
    * Find the tubes for storing the cups.
    * Carefully load the approved cups (rim up) into each of the four dispenser tubes. Ensure cups are stacked neatly and are not crushed or misaligned to prevent dispensing issues. Each tube holds up to 50 cups (for a total of 200 cups).
    * ![][cupsarea]
    * Make sure the cup storage tubes are secure in place.
    * Close the tube lids.
    * Close the service door.
5. **Load Candy:**
    * Open the left access door to gain access to the candy bays. 
    * ![][6candydisplays]
    * For initial setup, you may want to load a small amount of approved candy into each bay to test dispensing.
    * Unplug the barrel jack connector above the bay you want to fill
    * ![][CleanShot2025-05-12at133455]
    * Turn the locking mechanism that holds the candy display unit, so you can take it out.
    * ![][CleanShot2025-05-12at133545]
    * Open the door to the hopper/bay and add candy.
    * ![][CleanShot2025-05-12at133654]
    * Add candy to the display unit by removing the screws that hold the top part

    * Add the display candy and reverse all these steps to put everything back in place.
6. **Final Checks:**
    * Double-check that all internal packaging and temporary securing materials have been removed.
    * Ensure no tools or foreign objects are left inside the machine that might obstruct the functionality of the machine.
    * Turn on the compressor switch (this should be done last, as leaving this on for long periods of time while the doors are open might lead to leaking water).
