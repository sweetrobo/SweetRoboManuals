## 2\. Electrical Safety

* ⚠️ **WARNING: Electrical Shock Hazard. Can cause serious injury or death.**
* **Grounding:** Ensure the machine is reliably grounded. Plug the power cord into a properly grounded electrical outlet. Verify grounding with a socket tester if unsure.
* **Power Cord Inspection:** Before each use, inspect the power cord for any damage, cuts, or fraying. If the cord is damaged, do not operate the machine. Contact customer support for a replacement.
* **Correct Power Cord:** Use only the power cord supplied with the Candy Monster or an identical replacement recommended by the manufacturer.
* **No Liquids Near Electrical Components:** Keep all liquids away from the machine's electrical components, power inlet, and internal electronics. Do not immerse the machine or its electrical parts in water or any liquid.
* **Disconnect Power:** Always disconnect the machine from the power source (unplug it) before cleaning, performing maintenance, servicing, or when it's not in use for extended periods.
