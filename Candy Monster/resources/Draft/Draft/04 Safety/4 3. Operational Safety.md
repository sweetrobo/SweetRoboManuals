## 3\. Operational Safety

* **Stable Surface:** Operate the machine on a stable, flat, and level surface to prevent tipping or instability.
* •	**Clear Environment:** Keep the area around the machine clear of obstructions. Do not place the machine near flammable materials, heat sources (like direct sunlight or heaters), or excessive moisture.
* **Authorized Candy Only:** Only use candy types and sizes authorized by the manufacturer. Using unauthorized candies may cause dispensing issues, damage the machine, or create a safety hazard.
* **Avoid Overloading:** Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the maximum quantity of candy to load into each hopper/bay. Overloading can cause jams or damage the dispensing mechanism.
* **No Foreign Objects:** Do not insert hands, fingers, tools, or any foreign objects (e.g., iron filings, plastic, spoons, insects) into the dispensing chutes, candy hoppers, or any openings in the machine, especially during operation.
* **Emergency Stop:** Familiarize yourself with the main power switch to quickly shut down the machine in an emergency. If you observe any abnormalities, unusual noises, smoke, or overheating, immediately turn off and unplug the machine from it’s power source and contact customer support.
