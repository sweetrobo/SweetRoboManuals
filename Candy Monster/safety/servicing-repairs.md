## 5\. Servicing and Repairs

* **Qualified Technicians Only:** Repairs, modifications, or servicing beyond routine cleaning and operator-level maintenance (as described in this manual) should only be performed by qualified service technicians authorized by the manufacturer.
* **No Unauthorized Disassembly:** Attempting to disassemble or repair complex internal components yourself may void the warranty, result in further damage to the machine, or cause personal injury.
